# Usefn

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package contains commonly used R functions which I have used for the analysis and visualisation of genomic/transcriptomic data

## Installation

You can install the development version of Usefn from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nd-nehadaga/Usefn",build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
I ask for your patience. It takes few mins to download :) 
## Example

Refer the vignette for used example cases. Also the package contain attached example datasets.
