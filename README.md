This package contains commonly used R functions which I have used for the analysis and visualisation of genomic/transcriptomic data

## Installation

You can install the development version of Usefn from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nd-nehadaga/Usefn")
```

## Example

``` r
library(Usefn)
## To find overlap between two vectors of genomic coordinates

enhancer1 = c("ch2:1002-1500","ch1:30000-38000","ch5:70000-78252")
enhancer2 = c("ch2:1100-1200","ch1:37655-38000" ,"ch4:50000-57122")

```
